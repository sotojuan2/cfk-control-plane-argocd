			"expansionPrompt": "Refine the existing subtasks by adding specific examples for the compliant `KafkaTopic` manifest, detailing the exact GitHub Actions workflow run name to monitor, and specifying the expected success messages or log patterns from the OPA validation step.",
			"reasoning": "This task is an end-to-end positive test case, involving sequential steps across Git, Kubernetes manifest creation, GitHub Pull Requests, and GitHub Actions. While it's a positive test (expected to pass), it requires careful execution and verification across multiple systems. The existing 5 subtasks provide a comprehensive and appropriate breakdown for this type of testing, covering preparation, resource creation, PR submission, workflow monitoring, and cleanup. The complexity is moderate due to the multi-system interaction, but not high as it's not expected to fail or require significant debugging."
