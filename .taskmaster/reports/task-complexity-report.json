			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Refine OPA Policy and Enhance Error Reporting",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The task 'Refine OPA Policy and Enhance Error Reporting' is already broken down into 5 subtasks. Focus on executing these subtasks effectively, ensuring thorough analysis of edge cases, precise Rego policy updates for both logic and dynamic error messages, robust GitHub Actions integration for error display, and comprehensive end-to-end local validation.",
			"reasoning": "This is a complex parent task involving deep Rego policy analysis, refactoring for dynamic error messages, and intricate GitHub Actions integration to parse and display these messages. The existing 5 subtasks adequately break down this complexity into manageable, sequential steps, covering analysis, policy update, error message refactoring, GitHub Actions integration, and end-to-end testing, making the current number of subtasks appropriate."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create GitHub Actions Workflow File Structure",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of initializing the GitHub Actions workflow file. Consider steps for creating the `.github/workflows/opa-validation.yml` file, defining the basic YAML structure, and setting up the trigger (e.g., on pull requests targeting main/master) and a single validation job.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational and straightforward task involving creating a YAML file and defining basic GitHub Actions syntax. It's low complexity and can be adequately covered by 1-2 subtasks focusing on file creation and basic structure definition."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Test Workflow with Compliant Resources (Positive Case)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps required to perform end-to-end testing of the GitHub Actions workflow with compliant KafkaTopic resources. Include steps for preparing a test branch with valid KafkaTopic manifests, opening a pull request to trigger the workflow, and meticulously verifying the workflow's successful completion and logs.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves practical application and verification of the developed workflow. While a positive test case, it requires setting up a test environment (branch, manifest), triggering a PR, and carefully observing the workflow's successful completion, which can sometimes have subtle issues. It's a medium complexity task requiring a few distinct steps."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Test Workflow with Non-Compliant Resources (Negative Case)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline the process for end-to-end testing of the GitHub Actions workflow with non-compliant KafkaTopic resources. Focus on creating diverse invalid manifests to test various failure scenarios, triggering the workflow via a pull request, and meticulously verifying that the workflow fails as expected with precise, actionable error messages.",
			"reasoning": "This task is critical for validating the error reporting functionality developed in Task 6. It requires careful crafting of intentionally malformed manifests to test various failure scenarios and then meticulously verifying that the workflow fails as expected and provides precise, actionable error messages, adding to its complexity compared to the positive test case."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Develop OPA Rego Policy for KafkaTopic Naming",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the development of the OPA Rego policy for KafkaTopic naming. Include steps for translating the existing Gatekeeper logic into Rego, drafting the initial `deny` rule, performing comprehensive local testing with `opa eval` using sample valid and invalid manifests, and iteratively refining the policy based on test results.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires specific knowledge of Rego and OPA, as well as careful translation of existing policy logic. Developing robust Rego policies often involves iterative testing and refinement to cover various naming scenarios and edge cases, making it a medium-high complexity task that benefits from a structured breakdown."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Decommission Gatekeeper Policy and Constraint",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for safely decommissioning the Gatekeeper policy and constraint. Include coordination with the cluster operations team for constraint removal from the Kubernetes cluster, deleting the `kafkatopic-naming-template.yaml` file from the repository, and verifying that the Gatekeeper policy is no longer active or blocking resources.",
			"reasoning": "This task has an external dependency (coordination with cluster operations) and involves a sensitive operation (removing a policy from a production-like environment). It requires careful coordination and verification to ensure no unintended side effects, making it a medium complexity task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Code Checkout and Changed Manifest Identification",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of code checkout and changed manifest identification in the GitHub Actions workflow. Include steps for integrating the `actions/checkout` action, selecting and configuring a suitable `changed-files` action (e.g., `tj-actions/changed-files`), and setting up the filtering logic to identify only relevant Kubernetes manifest files (`.yaml`, `.yml`) within a pull request.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires familiarity with GitHub Actions marketplace actions and their configuration. Correctly identifying changed files, especially filtering for specific types and handling various PR scenarios, can sometimes have subtle configuration requirements, making it a medium complexity task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate OPA Validation Step into Workflow",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration of the OPA validation step into the GitHub Actions workflow. Include steps for selecting an appropriate OPA GitHub Action (e.g., `open-policy-agent/opa-check` or `actions/setup-opa` with `opa eval`), configuring it to process the identified KafkaTopic manifests, handling the OPA policy's output to determine workflow success or failure, and performing initial integration testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task is complex because it involves integrating OPA into the GitHub Actions workflow, which requires careful handling of inputs (manifests from Task 4), execution of the OPA policy (from Task 2), and processing of its output to determine the workflow's status. It's a critical integration point that benefits from a structured breakdown."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Analyze Existing Gatekeeper Policy",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the process for analyzing the existing Gatekeeper policy to extract the precise KafkaTopic naming convention. Include steps for locating and reviewing the `kafkatopic-naming-template.yaml` file, identifying the specific regex or rules applied to KafkaTopic names, and clearly documenting the precise naming requirements.",
			"reasoning": "This is primarily an analysis and documentation task. While it requires understanding policy language, it's about extraction rather than creation or complex integration. It's a low-medium complexity task that can be covered by a couple of focused subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Update Documentation (README.md)",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline the steps for updating the `README.md` file to reflect the new KafkaTopic validation process. Include drafting a new section explaining the shift-left validation using GitHub Actions and OPA, providing instructions on how developers can check policy compliance and interpret workflow failures, and reviewing the updated documentation for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward documentation task, dependent on the completion of the technical work. It's low complexity and can be covered by a couple of subtasks focusing on content creation and review."
